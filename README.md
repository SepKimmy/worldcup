Prove you know your football!


This website is aimed to be an experiment of mine on how databse collaboration and user input data can be incorporated into a website.


How to play
1. Install Examples for Developers (unpacking it to your Drupal sites/all/modules directory if you're isntalling by hand, for example).
2. Enable any Example modules in Admin menu > Site building > Modules.
3. Rebuild access permissions if you are prompted to.
4. Profit!  The examples will appear in your Navigation menu (on the left side bar by default; you'll need to reenable it if you removed it).

Now you can read the code and it's comments and see the result, experiment with it, and hopefully quickly grasp it's working.

If you find a problem, incorrect comment, obsolete or improper code or such, please let us know by creating a new issue at http://drupal.org/project/issues/examples
